Extracting code snippets from web pages is not a trivial problem, there are many technical challenges associated with it. Code snippets can be found for many different programming languages such as C++, Java, and Perl; and they can be found in different types of web pages such as blogs, tutorials, and forums. In this paper, we will focus on the extraction of code snippets in Java from tutorials. We preferred tutorials to other types of web pages because the source code they include is usually preceded or followed by natural language explanations that could be useful to determine the goal of a code snippet.
