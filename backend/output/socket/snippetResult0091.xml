This completes the code for the Server. As with the Client, the code in the Server is incorporated inside a try/catch block. This is required for compilation. As stated earlier, you will cover the various exceptions and how to handle them in later articles. Listing 3 contains the complete code for the Server.

Listing 3: The Server

Running the System

In this article, you simply set up the infrastructure for a working Client/Server model. There are many fascinating points that you will explore in future articles. However, you should get this basic model up and running so that you can verify that the system is in working order.

Compiling the Code

I compile the code using a DOS Shell. Eventually, you will need two of these DOS Shells&#8212;one to run the Server and one for the Client. You can open a DOS Shell in the Programs-&gt;Accessories option.

Type the following code at the command prompt to compile all three of the files.


&quot;C:Program FilesJavajdk1.5.0_06binjavac&quot; Employee.java
&quot;C:Program FilesJavajdk1.5.0_06binjavac&quot; Client.java
&quot;C:Program FilesJavajdk1.5.0_06binjavac&quot; Server.java


Figure 1 shows the screen shot of how this is accomplished.


Figure 1: Compiling the Code

Starting the Server

In one of the DOS Shells, type in the following line at the command prompt.

&quot;C:Program FilesJavajdk1.5.0_06binjava&quot; Server

Figure 2 shows what happens in the DOS Shell.


Figure 2: Starting the Server

If everything is working properly, the &quot;Server Waiting&quot; message is displayed. At this point, you can start the Client.

Starting the Client

In a separate DOS Shell, start the Client with the following line:

&quot;C:Program FilesJavajdk1.5.0_06binjava&quot; Client

The result is shown in Figure 3.


Figure 3: Starting the Client

If all is well, you will see that the employeeNumber and the employeeName both were changed. You can put some specific identification in the print statements to provide further assurance.

With the circuit complete, the Server should exit cleanly, as shown in Figure 4.


Figure 4: Completing the System

Conclusion

In this article, you covered the basic concepts involved with creating a simple Client/Server model. The code is a complete and functional model. There are many interesting aspects of Client/Server models that you have yet to explore.

Moving an object from one place to another is often a tricky proposition. Using modern object-oriented languages makes life a lot easier for today&apos;s programmers. It is very interesting to look at code from earlier programming languages pertaining to network programming. In years past, basic network programming required the programmer to develop code that was sometimes quite complex or purchase third-party software that was often hard to use. Languages such as Java and .NET have much of this functionality built right into the language.

As stated earlier, although the example of this article is complete and useful, it is quite basic. There are many more fascinating topics to explore regarding client/server applications. Next month, you will investigate several of these interesting topics.
