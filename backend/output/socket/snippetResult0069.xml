The Generic Connection Framework

J2SE includes many classes for performing input and output,
classes that are found in the java.io and the java.net packages.
Unfortunately, there are a large number of I/O classes and
they tend to encapsulate I/O models that are not necessarily
found on all devices. For example, some handheld devices do
not have file systems. Socket support is not universal, either.


What the CLDC has done, then, is to define a new set of
APIs for I/O called the Generic Connection Framework.
The GFC, part of the new javax.microedition.io
package, defines interfaces for the different kinds
of I/O that are possible and a factory class for
creating objects that implement those interfaces.
The type of object to create is specified in the
protocol part of the URL (universal resource locator)
passed to the factory class.

For example, a socket connection can be made
using code like this:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
import java.io.*;
import javax.microedition.io.*;

StreamConnection conn = null;
InputStream is = null;
String url = &quot;socket://somewhere.com:8909&quot;;

try {
    conn = (StreamConnection) Connector.open( url );
    is = conn.openInputStream();
    .... // etc. etc.
}
catch( ConnectionNotFoundException cnfe ){
    // handle it 
}
catch( IOException e ){
    // handle it
}
finally {
    if( is != null ) try { is.close(); } catch( Exception e ){}
    if( conn != null ) try { conn.close(); } catch( Exception e ){}
}
</CODE>

		The code above assumes that the device knows how to
map the &quot;socket&quot; protocol in the URL to an object that
implements the GCF&apos;s StreamConnection interface, which
defines methods for obtaining the input and output streams
of a socket connection. It should be noted, however,
that the CLDC does not actually define any I/O
implementations. In other words, the CLDC defines
the interfaces of the GCF, but the
implementation classes -- the ones that do the actual
I/O -- are left to the profiles and/or the device vendor
to define. For example, the Mobile Information Device
Profile (MIDP) -- a CLDC-based profile -- requires support
for a subset of HTTP 1.1 and so it recognizes the 
&quot;http&quot; protocol in URLs and returns objects that
implement the GCF&apos;s ContentConnection interface.


Using the CLDC
By itself, the CLDC is a limited programming
platform. Because it does not define any user
interface classes or implement any I/O models,
about all you can do for output is write to the
System.out stream, which may or may not be captured
to a console or file. You really need the extra
classes defined by a J2ME profile (like those of the MIDP)
or device-specific classes (like those on the RIM
BlackBerry devices or certain Japanese i-Mode phones)
to do anything interactive.

If you&apos;re still interested in trying out the CLDC,
Sun has a reference implementation hosted on Windows
or Solaris available for download from its website.
This reference implementation includes the preverify
offline verification utility as well as a CLDC VM
and the CLDC runtime classes. 
See Sun&apos;s
main CLDC page for links to it and to the CLDC
specification. You can also use toolkits or
integrated development environments like Sun&apos;s
J2ME 
Wireless Toolkit, Metrowerks&apos; 
CodeWarrior Wireless Studio,
or Borland&apos;s JBuilder
MobileSet to explore CLDC programming.
