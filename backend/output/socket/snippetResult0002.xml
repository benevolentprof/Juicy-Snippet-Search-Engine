A More Serious Issue

So far, I have covered the most common situations where HttpURLConnection works properly. However, I have encountered a few networks where HttpURLConnection is not usable.

It appears that the problem is linked to a faulty configuration of the DNS server. For some reason, HttpURLConnection always attempts to resolve the host name against the DNS server. Normally, it fails gracefully and the connection goes is rerouted through the proxy server. A few DNS servers return an inappropriate answer that results in a UnknownHostException.

There&apos;s an interesting theoretical debate as to whether the DNS server behaviour is acceptable. Although I am no expert on the topic, it would appear it is not. However, as a developer, you seldom have the option to reconfigure the DNS server, so you have to find a workaround.

My solution is to roll out my own implementation of the HTTP protocol. In its simplest form, a GET request looks like the following listing:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="7" >
String url = &quot;http://www.marchal.com/&quot;,
       proxy = &quot;proxy.mydomain.com&quot;,
       port = &quot;8080&quot;,
       authentication = &quot;usr:pwd&quot;;
URL server = new URL(url);
Socket socket = new Socket(proxy,port);
Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream(),
                                       &quot;US-ASCII&quot;);
writer.write(&quot;GET &quot; + server.toExternalForm() + &quot; HTTP/1.0\r\n&quot;);
writer.write(&quot;Host: &quot; + server.getHost() + &quot;\r\n&quot;);
writer.write(&quot;Proxy-Authorization: Basic &quot;
             + new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(
               authentication.getBytes())
             + &quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;);
writer.flush();
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(
                            socket.getInputStream(),&quot;US-ASCII&quot;));
String line = reader.readLine();
if(line != null &amp;&amp; line.startsWith(&quot;HTTP/&quot;))
{
   int sp = line.indexOf(&apos; &apos;);
   String status = line.substring(sp + 1,sp + 4);
   if(status.equals(&quot;200&quot;))
   {
      while(line.length() != 0)
         line = reader.readLine();
      readResponse(reader);
   }
   else
      throw new FileNotFoundException(&quot;Host reports error &quot; +
                                       status);
}
else
   throw new IOException(&quot;Bad protocol&quot;);
reader.close();
writer.close();
socket.close();
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="8" >
Notice that the proxy username and password are given as username:password and are later encoded in base 64. For a complete description of the HTTP protocol, turn to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt.

Conclusion

HTTP is an interesting protocol because it is supported by all corporate firewalls. The Java developer needs to pay special attention to proxies and other authentication issues, though.
