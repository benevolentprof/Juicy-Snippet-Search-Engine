Java Tutorial &#8211; Database Programming
This tutorial assumes knowledge of basic database concepts and MySQL.
In this Java tutorial you will learn how to connect to a MySQL database.
Connecting to a database will likely be a common task as your Java projects progress. In this JAVA tutorial, we will use the Java Database Connectivity API (Application Programming Interface) &#8211; JDBC to deliver our data.
The JDBC libraries provide the means to connect your programs to a database and perform any operations upon the data that you require. To start using JDBC you need:

the JDK (which you may already have installed)
a JBDC driver, which depends on the Database Management System you are using for your data.

Once you have installed a driver compatible with the DBMS for your data source, create a new Java project in your IDE. Enter the following import statement at the top of your Main Class:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
//import required for database operations
import java.sql.*;
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="2" >
Now enter your main method (this code is for MySQL databases, with notes where alterations are required for other systems):
