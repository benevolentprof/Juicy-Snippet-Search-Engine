Closing the Connection

Finally, you need to close the connection. This is another point where I ran into some confusion. Just as when I failed to commit the transaction, failing to close the connection can lead to the same problem. In some cases, the changes to the database were not permanent until the connection was closed. This is accomplished with the single line of code:

<CODE orderid="1" >
DBConnection.close();
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="2" >
The complete code for this method is presented in Listing 11.
