            What is JDBC?

The JDBC API is a Java API that can access any kind of tabular data,
especially data stored in a Relational Database.
JDBC helps you to write java applications that manage these three programming
activities:

  
  Connect to a data source, like a database 
  Send queries and update statements to the database 
  Retrieve and process the results received from the database in answer to
    your query

    

    The following simple code fragment gives a simple example of these three
    steps:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection
           ( &quot;jdbc:myDriver:wombat&quot;, &quot;myLogin&quot;,&quot;myPassword&quot;);
			  
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT a, b, c FROM Table1&quot;);
while (rs.next()) {
	int x = rs.getInt(&quot;a&quot;);
	String s = rs.getString(&quot;b&quot;);
	float f = rs.getFloat(&quot;c&quot;);
	}
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="2" >
This short code fragment instantiates a DriverManager object to
    connect to a database driver and log into the database, instantiates a Statement
    object that carries your SQL language query to the database; instantiates a ResultSet
    object that retrieves the results of your query, and executes a simple while
    loop, which retrieves and displays those results. It&apos;s that simple.
