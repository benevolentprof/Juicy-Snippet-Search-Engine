DataSource &amp; DriverManager


In this part of the JEE 5 tutorials, we will compare DataSource object with the DriverManager object. 




DataSource and the DriverManager are the two basic ways to connect to a database in a JEE application. The DriverManager is 
older facility, DataSource is newer. It is recommended to use the new DataSource facility to connect to databases and other
resources. DataSource facility has several advantages over DriverManager facility. Using DataSource increases portability.
The DataSource enables connection pooling and distributed transactions, the DriverManager does not allow such
techniques. Properties of a DataSource are kept in a configuration file. Any changes to the data source or database drivers
are made in the configuration file. In case of a DriverManager, these properties are hard coded in the application and for any changes we must recompile the code.



In this chapter, we will have two examples. One of the examples will use a DriverManager, the other one will use
a DataSource to connect to a MySQL database.
