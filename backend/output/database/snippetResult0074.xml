Creating Your Migration

You will use Rails Migrations to manage the creation and deletion of the database table that you are going to use to manage your Guitars from your app. Your table is going to conveniently be named guitars. Run the following from the railswartest direcrory:

jruby script/generate migration add_a_new_table
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
This will create the db/migrate/001_add_guitar_table.rb file:

		Figure 10: Creating our add_guitar_table migration

This file contains a Ruby class named AddGuitarTable that extends Rails&apos; ActiveRecord::Migration class. Edit this file to contain the following:
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="2" >
class AddGuitarTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
   def self.up
      create_table :guitars do |table|
         table.column :make,  :string, :null =&gt; false
         table.column :model, :string, :null =&gt; false
         table.column :color, :string, :null =&gt; false
      end
   end

   def self.down
      drop_table :guitars
   end
end
