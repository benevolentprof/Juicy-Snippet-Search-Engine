Solution for

    Programming Exercise 11.2



THIS PAGE DISCUSSES ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION to
the following exercise from this on-line
Java textbook.

Exercise 11.2:
Make a new version of the sample program WordList.java,
from Section 10.3, that stores words in a
binary sort tree instead of in an array.



Discussion


In WordList.java, an array is used
to store a list of (lower case) word in alphabetical order, and at the end of the
program the words are output to a file in order.  Since a binary sort tree
is designed to store words in alphabetical order, it can be used as 
a substitute for the array.  At the end of the program, an inorder
traversal of the tree can be used to output the words to the file.
Using an inorder traversal guarantees that the words will be output in order.

Only a few changes are needed in the main() routine.  They are
marked in red in the solution shown below.  It uses a differnt type of
variable, and it calls a few different routines, but the logic is unchanged.
The code that we need in
order to implement the binary sort tree can be copied almost directly
from Section 11.4.  The inorderPrint()
routine in that section prints its strings to standard output.  In order
to print to a file, I have added a parameter of type PrintWriter.
The main() routine provides a stream for writing to the
output file.

The treeInsert() routine from Section 11.4 has been renamed
to wordList() here, to be consistent with the subroutine call
in the main() routine.  I have also made a few other changes
to adapt it to this program.  The wordList() routine coverts
its parameter to lower case.  It also refuses to insert duplicate items
into the tree.  That is, if it finds a copy of the parameter already in
the tree, it returns without adding anything to the tree.

All-in-all, the substitution of the binary tree for the array is
very straightforward.


The Solution

Changes in the main() routine are shown in red.
In the part of the program that implements binary sort trees, changes
from the versions in Section 11.4 are shown in red.

      were found, without repetition, is written to the output file, with
      one word per line.  A word in this program is defined to be any
      sequence of letters.
