            How to Write a Tree Expansion Listener
            



Sometimes when using a 
tree, you might need to react when a branch becomes expanded or collapsed.
For example, you might need to load or save data.



Two kinds of listeners report expansion and collapse occurrences:
tree expansion listeners and tree-will-expand listeners.
This page discusses tree expansion listeners. 
See 
How to Write a Tree-Will-Expand
Listener for a description of Tree-Will-Expand listeners. 

A tree expansion listener detects when an expansion or collapse
has already occured.
In general, you should implement a tree expansion listener
unless you need to prevent an expansion or collapse from ocurring
.


&#160;

This example demonstrates a simple tree expansion listener.
The text area at the bottom of the window
displays a message every time a tree expansion event occurs.
It&apos;s a straightforward, simple demo.
To see a more interesting version that can veto expansions, see
How to Write a Tree-Will-Expand
Listener.





Try this:&#160;

Click the Launch button to run TreeExpandEventDemo using
Java&#8482; Web Start (download JDK 6).
     Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself,
     consult the
     example index.





 Expand a node.  A tree-expanded event is fired.
 Collapse the node.  A tree-collapsed event is fired.




The following code shows how the program handles expansion events.
You can find the source code for this example in

TreeExpandEventDemo.java.
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
public class TreeExpandEventDemo ... {
    ...
    void saySomething(String eventDescription, TreeExpansionEvent e) {
        textArea.append(eventDescription + &quot;; &quot;
                        + &quot;path = &quot; + e.getPath()
                        + newline);
    }

    class DemoArea ... implements TreeExpansionListener {
        ...
        public DemoArea() {
            ...
            tree.addTreeExpansionListener(this);
            ...
        }
        ...
        // Required by TreeExpansionListener interface.
        public void treeExpanded(TreeExpansionEvent e) {
            saySomething(&quot;Tree-expanded event detected&quot;, e);
        }

        // Required by TreeExpansionListener interface.
        public void treeCollapsed(TreeExpansionEvent e) {
            saySomething(&quot;Tree-collapsed event detected&quot;, e);
        }
    }
}

The Tree Expansion Listener API



The TreeExpansionListener
   Interface
TreeExpansionListener has no adapter class.


Method
Purpose




treeCollapsed(TreeExpansionEvent)
 Called just after a tree node collapses.





treeExpanded(TreeExpansionEvent)
 Called just after a tree node expands.




The TreeExpansionEvent API



Method
Purpose




Object getSource()
Return the object that fired the event.





TreePath getPath()
Returns a 
TreePath object that identifies each node from the root of the tree
 to the collapsed/expanded node, inclusive.
