            How to Write a Tree Selection Listener
            

To detect when the user selects a node in a
tree, you need to register a tree selection listener.
Here is an example, taken from 
the TreeDemo example discussed in
Responding to Node Selection, of detecting node selection
in a tree that can have at most one node 
selected at a time:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
tree.addTreeSelectionListener(new TreeSelectionListener() {
    public void valueChanged(TreeSelectionEvent e) {
        DefaultMutableTreeNode node = (DefaultMutableTreeNode)
                           tree.getLastSelectedPathComponent();

    /* if nothing is selected */ 
        if (node == null) return;

    /* retrieve the node that was selected */ 
        Object nodeInfo = node.getUserObject();
	...
    /* React to the node selection. */
	...
    }
});
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="2" >
To specify that the tree should support single selection,
the program uses this code:
</TEXT>
</result>
