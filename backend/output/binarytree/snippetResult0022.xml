8.3.2. Combo widget

A Combo widget allows users to select a value from a list of values or optionally enter a new value. The combo widget is similar to the List widget, but it uses a limited space.

Although the combo widget is a composite, it does not make sense to add child elements to it. Its elements must be of the String type. An element to a combo widget can be added by using the add(String element) method defined in the combo class.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Figure 12. Combo boxes in different styles.

The following SWT constants can be used with the Combo widget.



Table 8. SWT Combo style bit constants

SWT.DROP_DOWN
Drop-down combo box

SWT.READ_ONLY
Read-only combo box

SWT.SIMPLE
Simple combo box (not drop-down combo box). See Figure 11.



The following example shows a Combo widget&apos;s usage.



Source 9.  Combo example
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="3" >
final Combo combo =
   new Combo(shell,SWT.DROP_DOWN);
 for (int i = 1; i &lt; 11; i++)
 {
   combo.add(i+&quot;.) element &quot;);
 }
 combo.setText(&quot;Text&quot;);
 combo.addSelectionListener(
  new SelectionAdapter()
  {
    public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e)
    {
      System.out.println(&quot;Selection:&quot;+
                         combo.getText());
    }
  }
 );
</CODE>

8.3.3. Tree widget

A Tree widget represents a selectable hierarchy of items in a tree. Altough the Three class is a composite, it is not allowed to add composite classes to the Three class. Sub items of a Tree class must be of the ThreeItem type.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Figure 13. Tree widgets in different styles.

The following table shows a list of Tree widget constants.



Table 9. SWT Combo style bit constants

SWT.SINGLE
SWT.MULTI
Allows single or multiple selections

SWT.CHECK
shows a check box at the begining of each node



A simple Tree widget example is shown below.



Source 10. Tree example
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="5" >
final Tree tree =
   new Tree(shell,SWT.SINGLE);
 for (int i = 1; i &lt; 11; i++)
 {
   final TreeItem item1  =
    new TreeItem(tree,SWT.NULL);
   item1.setText(&quot;node &quot;+i);
   for (int j = 1; j &lt; 6; j++)
   {
     final TreeItem item11 = 
      new TreeItem(item1,SWT.NULL);
     item11.setText(&quot;node &quot;+i+&quot;.&quot;+j);
   }
 }

 tree.addSelectionListener(
  new SelectionAdapter()
  {
   public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e)
   {
     System.out.println(&quot;Selection:&quot;+
                   tree.getSelection()[0]);
   }
  }
 );
