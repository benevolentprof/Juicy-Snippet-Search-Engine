.

 The final example reports the output for a constructor which has been
declared with a generic parameter type:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="29" >
$ java ConstructorSift java.util.HashMap java.util.Map
public java.util.HashMap(java.util.Map&lt;? extends K, ? extends V&gt;)
      *GenericParameterType[0]: java.util.Map&lt;? extends K, ? extends V&gt;
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="30" >
Exception types may be retrieved for constructors in a similar way as for
methods.  See the
MethodSpy
example described in Obtaining Method Type
Information section for further details.
