The reactions to this solution are sometimes very poor. &quot;What if someone does create an instance?&quot; Well, then, you have a bigger problem than the singleton. If developers won&apos;t read how to properly use a class, and heed the advice, why produce all that Javadoc that your shop no doubt requires? What&apos;s the point of code reviews, if they can&apos;t catch problems like this?

In fact, all sorts of conventions can easily be circumvented by a nefarious developer. Java even allows external access to private fields through reflection tricks! Sometimes, the best solution is to simply say, &quot;don&apos;t do that.&quot;

You still can model the Catalog class similar to a singleton but provide hooks to allow it to cough up test doubles. You remove the private constructor from the Catalog class (see Listing 6). You provide a setInstance method to allow replacing the true, production singleton with a Catalog test double. Note the comment! You also can provide a reset method that tells the Catalog to begin using the production instance again. The reset ensures that your test doesn&apos;t gum up any other tests that expect to use the production Catalog instance.

<CODE orderid="5" >
import java.util.*;

public class Catalog {
   private static final Catalog DEFAULT = new Catalog();
   private static Catalog soleInstance = DEFAULT;

   private Map&lt;String,Book&gt; books = new HashMap&lt;String,Book&gt;();

   public static Catalog soleInstance() {
      return soleInstance;
   }

   // use for testing
   public static void setInstance(Catalog catalog) {
      soleInstance = catalog;
   }

   public static void reset() {
      soleInstance = DEFAULT;
   }
   //  ...
}
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="6" >
In summary, don&apos;t throw away your singletons! Just make sure that they don&apos;t cause any unit testing challenges.
