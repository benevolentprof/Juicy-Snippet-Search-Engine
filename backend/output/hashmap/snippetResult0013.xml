Native List and Map Syntax
Like Jython (my previous favorite JVM-based scripting language), Groovy has some very powerful support for lists and maps built in. For example, instead of having to say:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
HashMap myMap = new HashMap();
myMap..put(&quot;1&quot;,&quot;Fred&quot;);
myMap.put(&quot;2&quot;,&quot;George&quot;);
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="2" >
You can use the much shorter and clearer:
groovyMap = [&quot;1&quot;:&quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;2&quot;:&quot;George&quot;]

		Give it a try in the GroovyConsole and run it; you should see the groovyMap contents printed to the command line standard output.
Likewise, list support is built in:
myList = [1,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;Three&quot;,4]
Note: Boxing for the int values in the list is handled for you, so the above is perfectly valid Groovy syntax.
Not much exciting there, but the simplicity continues:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="3" >
copyList = myList[1..2]
</CODE>
</result>
