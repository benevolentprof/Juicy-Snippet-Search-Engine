Follow-up to JDK 1.4 HashMap hashCode() mystery

2002-08-15 The Java Specialists&apos; Newsletter [Issue 054b] - Follow-up to JDK 1.4 HashMap hashCode() mystery
Author:
  Dr. Heinz M. Kabutz

This is just a quick follow-up to the newsletter sent this morning
at 2:00am South African time.  It seems I was not very careful with
the source code and a few errors crept in.  Please have a look at
the
archive for a corrected edition.  After finally collapsing in
bed at 2:15am, I was rudely reminded that I have a daughter of 11 months
old.  She kept up her antics until 6:00am, when I had to get up to
carry on presenting my Java
course.  *sigh* - today was not a good day!




Joshua Bloch wrote to me after last night&apos;s newsletter, sending me some
more information about the remainder performance mystery, and I feel I
should pass the information on to you, my readers:




Joshua Bloch: By the way, I now know more
about what&apos;s going on with mod/division.  There is a collection of
techniques for doing fast division by a constant.  These techniques are
covered in great detail in Chapter 10 of a marvelous new book with the
unlikely title of &quot;Hacker&apos;s Delight&quot; by Henry
Warren.  It turns out that the old (&quot;Classic&quot;) VM knew some of these tricks, but
Hotspot, in releases up to 1.4, did not.  While 1.4.1 can do some of
this stuff, I suspect that later releases will do more.





I wrote a FairRemainderBenchmark that calculates the remainder with a
variable, the way that the old HashMap would have done, and alas, the
speed of the various JDKs is roughly the same:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="1" >
import java.util.Random;
public class FairRemainderBenchmark implements Benchmark {
  private static final int ITERATIONS = 10 * 1000 * 1000;
  private int memory;
  public int doCalculation() {
    int val = 0;
    Random rand = new Random(0);
    int bucket_size = (int)(rand.nextDouble() * 101) + 1;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++) {
      val = i % bucket_size;
    }
    memory = val;
    return ITERATIONS;
  }
}
</CODE>
<TEXT orderid="2" >
The performance is now quite similar between the old and the new versions
of the JVM:



JVM version:1.2
18867  18832  18484  19193  18832  18518  19193  18832  18484  18832
Average 18806 iterations per millisecond

JVM version:1.3.1_03
18867  18148  18832  18484  18484  18867  18832  18832  18148  18484
Average 18597 iterations per millisecond

JVM version:1.4.0
18832  19193  19230  19193  19193  19193  19193  19230  19193  19193
Average 19164 iterations per millisecond

JVM version:1.4.1-beta
17825  18148  18148  18148  17543  18484  18148  18148  17513  18518
Average 18062 iterations per millisecond
