This gives you enough to run the example. Save all unsaved files and do the following:

Right-click the plug-in project in your Package Explorer and choose Run As -&gt; Eclipse Application. This will create a new Eclipse Launch Configuration with default values (which are sufficient for this example), and launch it. 
When the run-time workbench comes up, you should be greeted by the Welcome view. Click Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other... and select Developer.com -&gt; Superview. Click OK.

What you should see is the Superview showing a list of entries in the form &quot;View(&lt;view id&gt;)&quot; (refer to Figure 2). This result is acceptable for the purpose of this exercise&#151;you demonstrated the process of developing a simple visual plug-in using PDE, without going into too much API detail. However, if you want to delve deeper into JFace before the next installment of the series comes out, read on to see how you can make the view&apos;s contents more human-readable.
At this point, each entry in the table represents a workbench view; the model object you provided as the viewer&apos;s input is an array of view descriptors (IViewDescriptor), and the content provider you used turns any array object into a list of its elements (basically, given the array object as the parent, it returns its elements as the children). But, the label provider you installed simply uses each element&apos;s toString() method as its label. Interface IViewDescriptor does provide a method to get the view&apos;s label (getLabel()), and even the view&apos;s icon image (getImageDescriptor()). All you need to do to take advantage of them is override two of the label provider&apos;s methods:

Close runtime workbench. In the Superview.java editor, subclass new LabelProvider() as shown in Listing 3: 

Listing 3: Label provider customization:

<CODE orderid="3" >
viewer.setLabelProvider(new LabelProvider() {
&#160;&#160; 
&#160;&#160;&#160; private final Map images = new HashMap();
&#160;&#160; 
&#160;&#160;&#160; public String getText(Object element) {
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; return ((IViewDescriptor) element).getLabel();
&#160;&#160;&#160; }
&#160;&#160; 
&#160;&#160;&#160; public Image getImage(Object element) {
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Image image = (Image) images.get(element);
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; if (image == null) {
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; IViewDescriptor view = (IViewDescriptor) element;
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; ImageDescriptor desc = view.getImageDescriptor();
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; image = desc.createImage();
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; images.put(element, image);
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; }
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; 
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; return image;
&#160;&#160;&#160; }
&#160;&#160; 
&#160;&#160;&#160; public void dispose() {
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; for (Iterator i = images.values().iterator(); i.hasNext();)
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; ((Image) i.next()).dispose();
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; 
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; super.dispose();
&#160;&#160;&#160; }
});
