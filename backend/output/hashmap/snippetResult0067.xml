in this example. The test fails because the create method returns distinct Time instances. The failing reuseOfMemory test drives me to change the implementation in TimeFactory:
</TEXT>
<CODE orderid="17" >
import java.util.*;

public class TimeFactory {
   private static Map&lt;String,Time&gt; times = new HashMap&lt;String,Time&gt;();
   public static Time create(byte hour, byte minute) {
      String key = hour + &quot;:&quot; + minute;
      Time time = times.get(key);
      if (time == null) {
         time = new Time(hour, minute);
         times.put(key, time);
      }
      return time;
   }
}
